This is a python script that I wrote to enhance the experience with Ollama Local AI, this script uses the Llama3.1 AI and install two things:
1. Python package 'Ollama' using `pip install ollama`
2. Llama 3.1 AI using `ollama pull llama3.1`
The requirements for using these scripts are simple:
1. Python 3.x installed
2. At least 5GB of storage
3. Internet (Only for the first run)

This AI is much safer than Cloud-AI such as ChatGPT, because the AI is installed on your computer rather than online.
Hope you enjoy using this AI.
